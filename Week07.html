<!-- This is the home page. I've taken inspiration from an MDN page about the <nav> tag to use both a standard <div> for links to other pages as well as a text element with imbedded links to the other pages.-->
    
    <h1>Home</h1>
    <div>
        <a href="Contact.html">Contact</a>
        <a href="Information.html">Information</a>
        <a href="form.html">Bliss</a> <!--I've labeled the Form submission page "Bliss" at this location to match the text below, even though it navigates to the "Form Submission" page.
             I believe honesty is important in web design, and one of the things I have seen many people fall prey to is falsely labeled links. Many email phishing scams use maliciously false labels for hyperlinks. 
             It is important as a user to hover over any suspicious links to check their destination url, but many people don't know how to do this. It is shockingly easy to take advantage of the technologically illiterate.
             It is important for designers to use full transparency and honesty when inviting users to navigate pages, both externally and interally.-->

        <p> 
            Welcome to the Home Page. All is quiet in this small, unadorned space. <br>
            In front of you lie three doors: the first is labeled <a href="Contact.html">"Contact,"</a> though no further context is given. <br>
            The second reads <a href="Information.html">"Information,"</a> and looks mind-numbingly dull. <br>
            The third is adorned in jewels and gold inlay, and written in flowing silver script is the word <a href="form.html">"Bliss."</a> <br>
            Scattered about the current room is a selection of furniature with very pedestrian taste, complete with tacky magazines. <br>
            There seems no point in staying here. Why not choose one of the doors?
        </p>
